# Search-Engine
 Our Proposal for the "Modern Search Engines" Group project

## Creators:
 - Lukas Weber
 - Dana Rapp
 - Simon ...
 - Max ...

## Search Engine Structure
1. Crawler: Crawls the web for documents starting from the frontier
 - Store page-specific update frequencies in the frontier (Necessary?)!
 - Consider Access control (robots.txt)
 - Duplicate detection (exact and near duplicates)
   - [ ] Simhash
   - [ ] Autoencoders
3. Indexing: Saving the crawled content. Optimizing speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query so the search engine does not have to scan every document in the corpus
4. Matching Query and Documents & Ranking
5. Search Engine Interface
6. What about Fairness and Bias? (Part of the Slides about the project phase)

## TODOs

- Finish Crawler

- Choose Frontier
