Tübingen (German: [ˈtyːbɪŋən] (listen); Swabian: Dibenga) is a traditional university city in central Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated 30 km (19 mi) south of the state capital, Stuttgart, and developed on both sides of the Neckar and Ammer rivers. As of 2014[update][3] about one in three of the 90,000 people[citation needed] living in Tübingen is a student. As of the 2018/2019 winter semester, 27,665 students attend the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen.[citation needed] The city has the lowest median age in Germany, in part due to its status as a university city. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of a citizen of Tübingen is 39.1 years.[citation needed]
Immediately north of the city lies the Schönbuch, a densely wooded nature park. The Swabian Alb mountains rise about 13 km (8 mi) (beeline Tübingen City to Roßberg - 869 m) to the southeast of Tübingen.
The Ammer and Steinlach rivers are tributaries of the Neckar river, which flows in an easterly direction through the city, just south of the medieval old town. Large parts of the city are hilly, with the Schlossberg and the Österberg in the city centre and the Schnarrenberg and Herrlesberg, among others, rising immediately adjacent to the inner city.
The highest point is at about 500 m (1,640.42 ft) above sea level near Bebenhausen in the Schönbuch forest, while the lowest point is 305 m (1,000.66 ft) in the city's eastern Neckar valley. The geographical centre of the state of Baden-Württemberg is in a small forest called Elysium, near the Botanical Gardens of the city's university.


History[edit]
Further information: County Palatine of Tübingen
The area was probably first settled by ancient humans in the 12th millennium BC. The Romans left some traces here in AD 85, when they built a limes frontier wall at the Neckar River. Tübingen dates from the 6th or 7th century, when the region was populated by the Alamanni people. Some historians argue that the Battle of Solicinium was fought at Spitzberg, a mountain in Tübingen, in AD 367, although there is no evidence for this.[citation needed]
Tübingen first appears in official records in 1191. The local castle, Hohentübingen, has records going back to 1078, when it was besieged by Henry IV, king of Germany. Its name was transcribed in Medieval Latin as Tuingia and Twingia.
From 1146, Count Hugo V (1125–52) was promoted to count palatine as Hugo I. Tübingen was established as the capital of a County Palatine of Tübingen. By 1231, Tübingen was a civitas, indicating recognition by the Crown of civil liberties and a court system.
In 1262, an Augustinian monastery was established by Pope Alexander IV in Tübingen; in 1272, a Franciscan monastery was founded. In 1300, a Latin school (today's Uhland-Gymnasium) was founded. During the Protestant Reformation, which Duke Ulrich of Württemberg converted to, he disestablished the Franciscan monastery in 1535.
In 1342, the county palatine was sold to Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg and incorporated into the County of Württemberg.

Between 1470 and 1483, St. George's Collegiate Church was built. The collegiate church offices provided the opportunity for what soon afterwards became the most significant event in Tübingen's history: the founding of the Eberhard Karls University by Duke Eberhard im Bart of Württemberg in 1477, thus making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It became soon renowned as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire, especially for theology (a Protestant faculty, Tübinger Stift, was established in 1535 in the former Augustinian monastery). Today, the university is still the biggest source of income for the residents of the city and one of the biggest universities in Germany with more than 26,000 students.
Between 1622 and 1625, the Catholic League occupied Lutheran Württemberg in the course of the Thirty Years' War. In the summer of 1631, the city was raided. In 1635/36 the city was hit by the Plague. In 1638, Swedish troops conquered Tübingen. Towards the end of the war, French troops occupied the city from 1647 until 1649.
In 1789, parts of the old town burned down, but were later rebuilt in the original style. In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading newspaper in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen by Johann Friedrich Cotta. From 1807 until 1843, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin lived in Tübingen in a tower overlooking the Neckar.
In the Nazi era, the Tübingen Synagogue was burned in the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938. The Second World War left the city largely unscathed, mainly because of the peace initiative of a local doctor, Theodor Dobler. It was occupied by the French army and became part of the French zone of occupation. From 1946 to 1952, Tübingen was the capital of the newly formed state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern (as French: Tubingue), before the state of Baden-Württemberg was created by merging Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The French troops had a garrison stationed in the south of the city until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.
In the 1960s, Tübingen was one of the centres of the German student movement and the Protests of 1968 and has ever since shaped left and green political views. Some radicalized Tübingen students supported the leftist Rote Armee Fraktion terrorist group, with active member Gudrun Ensslin, a local and a Tübingen student from 1960 to 1963, joining the group in 1968.
Although noticing such things today is largely impossible, as recently as the 1950s, Tübingen was a very socioeconomically divided city, with poor local farmers and tradesmen living along the Stadtgraben (City Canal) and students and academics residing around the Alte Aula and the Burse, the old university buildings. There, hanging on the Cottahaus, a sign commemorates Goethe's stay of a few weeks while visiting his publisher. The German tendency to memorialize every minor presence of its historical greats (comparable to the statement "Washington slept here" in the United States) is parodied on the building next door. This simple building, once a dormitory, features a plain sign with the words "Hier kotzte Goethe" (lit.: "Goethe puked here").
In the second half of the 20th century, Tübingen's administrative area was extended beyond what is now called the "core city" to include several outlying small towns and villages. Most notable among these is Bebenhausen, a village clustered around a castle and Bebenhausen Abbey, a Cistercian cloister about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Tübingen.

Overview[edit]
In 2020[update], the city had 90,000 inhabitants. Life in the city is dominated by its roughly 28,000 students. Tübingen is best described as a mixture of old and distinguished academic flair, including liberal and green politics on one hand and traditional German-style student fraternities on the other, with rural-agricultural environs and shaped by typical Lutheran-Pietist characteristics, such as austerity and a Protestant work ethic, and traditional Swabian elements, such as frugality, order, and tidiness. The city is home to many picturesque buildings from previous centuries and lies on the River Neckar.
In 1995[update], the German weekly magazine Focus published a national survey, according to which Tübingen had the highest quality of life of all cities in Germany. Factors taken into consideration included the infrastructure, the integration of bicycle lanes into the road system, a bus system connecting surrounding hills and valleys, late-night services, areas of the city that can be reached on foot, the pedestrianised old town, and other amenities and cultural events offered by the university. Tübingen is the city with the youngest average population in Germany.

Main sights[edit]
 View from the tower of StiftskircheIn central Tübingen, the Neckar divides briefly into two streams, forming the elongated Neckarinsel (Neckar Island), famous for its Platanenallee with high plane trees, which are around 200 years old. Pedestrians can reach the island via stairs on the narrow ends leading down from a bridge spanning the Neckar. During the summer, the Neckarinsel is occasionally the venue for concerts, plays, and literary readings. The row of historical houses across one side of the elongated Neckarinsel is called the Neckarfront and includes the house with adjoining tower where poet Friedrich Hölderlin stayed for the last 36 years of his life, as he struggled with mental instability.

Tübingen's Altstadt (old town) survived the World War II due to the city's lack of heavy industry. The result is a growing domestic tourism business as visitors come to wander through one of the few completely intact historic Altstädte in Germany. The highlights of Tübingen include its crooked cobblestone lanes, narrow-stair alleyways picking their way through the hilly terrain, streets lined with canals, and well-maintained traditional half-timbered houses.
Old city landmarks include the city hall on Markt Square and the Hohentübingen Castle, now part of the University of Tübingen. The central landmark is the Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Along with the rest of the city, the Stiftskirche was one of the first to convert to Martin Luther's protestant church. As such, it maintains (and carefully defends) several "Roman Catholic" features, such as patron saints. Below the Rathaus is a quiet, residential street called the Judengasse, the former Jewish neighborhood of Tübingen until the city's Jews were expelled in 1477. On the street corner is a plaque commemorating the fate of Tübingen's Jews.
The centre of Tübingen is the site of weekly and seasonal events, including regular market days on the Holzmarkt by the Stiftskirche and the Marktplatz by the Rathaus, an outdoor cinema in winter and summer, festive autumn and Christmas markets and (formerly) Europe's largest Afro-Brazilian festival.
Students and tourists also come to the Neckar River in the summer to visit beer gardens or go boating in Stocherkähne, the Tübingen equivalent of Oxford and Cambridge punts, only slimmer. A Stocherkahn carries up to 20 people. On the second Thursday of June, all Stocherkahn punts take part in a major race, the Stocherkahnrennen.
Bebenhausen Abbey lies in the village of Bebenhausen, a district of Tübingen. A subdivision of the pilgrimage route known as the Way of St. James starts here and runs through Tübingen.

Government[edit]
Tübingen is governed by the mayor, elected by citizens every eight years, and by the municipal council, elected by citizens every five years.[4] Boris Palmer, a former member of the Greens, is the mayor since 2007, re-elected in 2014 and 2022 and thus on his third term until 2030.[5]
Tübingen's council decided that the city should be climate-neutral by 2030.[6][7] In 2022, the city was the first in Germany to tax disposable food packaging.[8] Restaurants in Tübingen are charged 50 cents per disposable cup and cardboard bowl, and 20 cents per piece of cutlery.[9]

Regional structure[edit]
 Tübingen (lower right) on the Neckar, in southwest Germany
Tübingen is the capital of an eponymous district and an eponymous administrative region (Regierungsbezirk), before 1973 called Südwürttemberg-Hohenzollern.
Tübingen is, with nearby Reutlingen (about 15 km (9.3 mi) east), one of the two centre cities of the Neckar-Alb region.
Administratively, it is not part of the Stuttgart Region, bordering it to the north and west (Böblingen district). However, the city and northern parts of its district can be regarded as belonging to that region in a wider regional and cultural context.

Districts[edit]
Tübingen is divided into 22 districts, the city core of twelve districts (population of about 51,000) and ten outer districts (suburbs) (population of about 31,000):
Core city districts:


Französisches Viertel

Culture[edit]
Tübingen has a notable arts culture as well as nightlife. In addition to the full roster of official and unofficial university events that range from presentations by the university's official poet in residence to parties hosted by the student associations of each faculty, the city can boast of several choirs, theatre companies and nightclubs. Also, Tübingen's Kunsthalle (art exhibition hall), on the "Wanne", houses two or three exhibits of international note each year.

Population[edit]
Population development[edit]
Since World War II, Tübingen's population has almost doubled from about 45,000 to the current 88,000, also due to the incorporation of formerly independent villages into the city in the 1970s.
Currently, Lord Mayor Boris Palmer (Green Party) has set the ambitious goal of increasing the population of Tübingen to 100,000 within the next several years. To achieve this, the city is closing gaps between buildings within the city proper by allowing new houses to be built there; this is also to counter the tendency of urban sprawl and land consumption that has been endangering the preservation of rural landscapes of Southern Germany. [1]

Research in Tübingen
Tübingen is a special place for research. Very few locations offer such a wide range of research areas in such close proximity - both physically and figuratively. Not only are all of Tübingen's research institutions just a stone's throw away from each other, they also collaborate closely within the Tübingen Research Campus.


Excellence Strategy
Tübingen's unique research environment provides an ideal ground for collaborative projects in various areas. This is one of the many reasons why Tübingen is receiving funding from the German Federal and State Governments Excellence Strategy. As a consequence, excellence attracts further excellence: Over the years, more and more top-level research institutions have come to the city, forming the rich and vibrant academic community of the Tübingen Research Campus.


Joint Initiatives in Tübingen
Tübingen is an ideal place for collaboration due to the physical proximity of the partners of the TRC, which are further embedded in regional, national and international networks. Graduate and PhD programs also benefit from the presence of top-level experts at different research institutions, making Tübingen a hotspot for interdisciplinary graduate training. Here, you find a list of examples of local cooperation projects.

The City of Tübingen - some basic facts
Tübingen is an old city, but it has one of the youngest populations in Germany: the inhabitants are only 39 years old on average. 28,500 of the 90,000 residents are students. The town is famous for its unique flair, combining the charm of a lovingly restored old town center with the bustling spirit of a young student town.   Tübingen is located about 30 miles south of Stuttgart between the Schönbuch Natural Park and the Swabian Alb. On the south side of the old town flows the river Neckar.  The City of Tübingen provides a map with places of interest (in German) to help you find your way around. 


Cost of Living
Despite being a comparatively small city, Tübingen is an expensive place to live. Rents especially are among the highest in the country. In total, you should expect to spend at least EUR 950 - 1000/month for your living costs as a single person.If you will need a residence permit to stay in Germany, you will have to provide proof of sufficient financial means. For a single person, the official monthly requirement isEUR 502 +
Cost of rent (including additional, heating costs and electricity  
(for people with a work contract) EUR 100 “Werbungskostenpauschale” (income-related lump sum) 
(for people without a work contract) cost of health insurance.  
For visa and residence permits for the purpose of study (§ 16 b), the official requirement is EUR 934/month (2023). Please note that particularly the first two months will be expensive because you might need to buy things like household items, tickets for public transportation/a bike, apply for a residence permit etc. However, of course your expenditures also depend on your individual lifestyle.Short list of main costs (monthly)Accommodation: private one-room apartment or PhD student dormitory

Please contact the University of Tübingen's international admissions team for details.


Safety in Tübingen
Tübingen is a safe city with a very low crime rate, even by German standards. Nonetheless, train stations may attract dodgy individuals, so please be careful around these areas, especially at night. Generally, it’s better to not walk alone at night if you can avoid it.  Being a very bike-friendly city, one crime that is unfortunately comparatively frequent is bike theft. Make sure to invest in a good lock, and don’t leave your bike unattended in town for too long, especially if it looks expensive.  We strongly recommend to always lock your front door and close all windows when you leave the house. 


Being LGBT* in Tübingen
Tübingen is a very liberal city and generally a safe place to live, no matter your sexual orientation or gender identity. Same-sex marriage is legal in Germany, and anti-discrimination laws protect minorities. While homophobia and transphobia are unfortunately not yet a thing of the past, the majority of the Tübingen population has a neutral/positive attitude towards their fellow LGBT* citizens, and many people choose to be out at work and within their circle of friends. If you need further information about support groups and meetups, please contact your personal support.

Tübingen [1] is a small university town, located near the geographic center of Baden-Württemberg, roughly 30km southwest of Stuttgart.

Understand[edit]
Tübingen's population of about 85,000 people is a mixture of students, researchers and academics, medical specialists, and "Gorgen" (the people whose families have been there forever, they used to grow wine berries on the hills around the town. "gorge" ~ cork). The university and its network of hospitals are its economic lifeblood (and the biggest employer in southern Württemberg); Eberhard-Karls-Universität, founded in 1477, is reputed to be one of the top 5 German universities for studies in German, medicine, and law, and Tübingen serves as a regional medical service hub (they even have a malaria clinic). 
About 20,000 students fill Tübingen's pubs, cafe patios, and university lecture halls during "lecture time" (mid of October until mid of February and mid of April until mid of July). Meanwhile, the high concentration of educated folks with lots of free time means that there are plenty of things to do for the size of the town - 16 choirs; 3 theatres; a fine little art gallery; special lecture series at the university; and, of course, constant parties hosted by the student associations of the various departments (it's almost a competition to see whether the chemists or the anthropologists do it better). The town does get quiet, though, in the breaks between semesters (Feb 15 - Apr 15, Jul 15 - Oct 15).
The city dates back to 1078 A.D. and is remarkably well-preserved; only one bomb fell in World War II - on the house where Goethe lived (or was it Schiller?). The "old town", which lies along the Neckar River, looks much as it would have in the 1600s - its crooked, cobblestoned streets will have you walking in circles when you're not climbing up and down the stairs built into the sidewalks! The Arts campus of the university lies nearby, while more modern science faculties and student residences perch on the large hills that surround the center of town. Everywhere you go, there are signs of those who went before, sometimes literally ("Dr. Alzheimer worked in this building"), sometimes less so - you can find Tübingen's traces in the writings of Hesse and Hoelderlin...
Tübingen has fairly good weather compared to the rest of Germany (slightly worse than Freiburg, though). Sudden changes in the weather can make your ears pop heading up into the hills by bus, or just sitting in the marketplace in the center of town! The medieval architecture, the students' joie de vivre, the 40% of residents who vote for the Green Party, the absurd charm of the constant festivals that wind through the streets...it's a unique little spot.

Get in[edit]
By plane[edit]
Stuttgart Echterdingen is the closest airport. From there, the easiest way into Tübingen is the 828 Sprinter bus, which runs hourly and takes approx. 48 minutes to about an hour. For bus schedules, go to [2]. At the bottom left of the page under Mini-Fahrpläne, type in 828 and choose the one with the RBS company. 
Alternatively, take the train to Herrenberg, and then the S-Bahn train from there to the airport.
If coming from Frankfurt, it takes about 2 to 2.5 hours with at least a change in Stuttgart and sometimes in Mannheim as well. See [3] and click on the 'International' tab for English pages.

By train[edit]
The train from Stuttgart takes about 45min by IRE train or around 1hr by normal train. If you arrive at the main station of Tübingen, don't let the ugly and uninviting surroundings of the train station put you off. Just leave the station behind and keep going (north) and after 10min. walking you'll be right in the old town center.

By car[edit]
With Tübingen's terrible traffic system, lots of one-way streets, and some very eager ticket officers, it is best to park your car as soon as possible and then explore the city on foot, by bus, or by bicycle. Finding a spot to park your car can be quite a pain, especially close to the center of the city. Almost every street there may only be used by residents at night, and during the day there are parking meters. Be sure to check the signs and how long you are allowed to park there, and if you are not sure, look for another spot. Ticket officers are very quick in Tübingen. If you need to park your car near downtown, you can use parking garages, but be advised, they are not cheap.

Get around[edit]
The best way to get around Tübingen and its surroundings is by bicycle, just like thousands of Tübingen's students. Tübingen is fairly hilly. Just don't forget to lock your bike!
Tübingen has a solid bus system, and a day pass gets you unlimited rides from 8:30AM. After the buses stop running on Thursday through Friday nights, certain night bus routes are available throughout the city (check the posted schedules at the respective bus stops to see which bus routes stop where and when).  On other nights, it is possible to call for a very inexpensive ride on the shared cab service (Sammel Anruf Mietwagen, or SAM)[4] (page in German only).
Bus tickets can be bought on board every bus (with coins or GeldKarte/ATM Cards only - no paper bills accepted) from the machine behind the driver, or at machines at selected bus stops (but only with a GeldKarte). The machine on the bus is rather non-intuitive, so be prepared to ask friendly-looking passengers for help. Note that if you already have a ticket, you can board a bus through any of the doors, as the driver does not inspect tickets upon boarding; rather, fare inspectors patrol the buses at random points during the route. If caught without a valid ticket, fares are a hefty 60€.
Time tables and maps are available from Stadtverkehr Tübingen homepage [5].

See[edit]
Tübingen's scenic location between the forests, the Swabian Jura (Schwäbische Alb), and the river Neckar make it a beautiful stop in southwest Germany. Its flair is comparable to cities like Heidelberg or Freiburg, although Tübingen is smaller than those cities.  The primary attraction is the unspoiled Altstadt (city center) and the lively student population.

City centre, full of crooked half-timbered houses, small alleys, cobblestone roadwork, and some nice old churches.
River Neckar next to the city center, on which the students go punting (similar to what they do in Oxford or Cambridge) in the summertime, occasionally with a barbecue and a crate of beer on board.
Schloss, or castle, can be a fun place to wander around. Look at the intricately carved gate at the entrance. Skip most of the center courtyard and head up the stairs on the back side of the courtyard. This leads to a beautiful garden/courtyard, with some beautiful views from atop the wall to the left. Alternatively, go through the tunnel on the backside of the main courtyard that will take you through the backside of the castle, a much more medieval and beautiful part of the Schloss. From back here there is a path that will take you along the wall of the castle and through the woods, ending up on Haaggasse very near the Marktplatz.
Kunsthalle Tübingen, Philosophenweg 76, ☎ +49 (0) 70 71 / 96 91 0, [x]. A small modern art museum on one of the hills.   edit
Neuer botanischer Garten is a sight to see during the summer if you like gardens and plants. It's part of the university and entry is free. There's a giant greenhouse with tropical and subtropical plants. Don't forget to walk past the rather unexciting stone garden and small plants: there's more to see down the hill and an Arboretum across the road to the north.

Tübingen is situated at the southern rim of the Schönbuch[6], a large forest preservation area that offers some beautiful scenery for hiking, cycling, etc.
If you arrive in Tübingen in the summer, make sure you take some time to stroll along the Neckar River, maybe get some ice cream and sit on the old city wall above the water.
If you are more adventurous, you might try at punting: push a large wooden boat with up to 14 passengers along the river using a long wooden pole. It's not as easy as some of the professional punters make it look.
In June (normally at lunch on the second Thursday of the month), there is a famous punt boat race (Stocherkahnrennen) in which more than 40 punting boats race along the river, trying not to come in last, as each crew member of the last boat has to drink half a liter of sun-warmed cod-liver oil. Traditionally, most of Tübingen's student fraternities participate in the race, but also private crews are allowed.
At certain times, there are archers shooting in the eastern moat (the "Hasengraben") of the castle. You find their shooting times here[7] (German only).
If it's warm and you got the time, consider doing a day trip from the Tübinger Schloss to the Wurmlinger Kapelle. It's a nice scenic walk through the woods, and the Wurmlinger Kapelle sits on top of a small hill that offers a great view. One way will take you roughly 90 minutes. On the way back, consider visiting the Schwärzlocher Hof to enjoy some fine Swabian cuisine.
Learn[edit]
The Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen [8] dates from 1477, making it one of the oldest in Germany.
The city is also host to several research institutes including the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics [9], Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology [10], The Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the MPG [11], and the Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research [12].
Buy[edit]
Vinum, on Lange Gasse, across from the Stiftskirche, has many wines, spirits, and other things, and a great atmosphere to boot. A great place to buy a gift for someone.
Mokka, on Collegiumsgasse near the Wilhelmstift, is a great place to buy teas, coffees, and chocolates. Again, a great place to buy gifts for someone.
There are some tourist shops that sell souvenirs (mugs, T-Shirts etc.): one at Holzmarkt and the other at Marktplatz, furthermore one in tourist information at Neckarbrücke.
University Shop, Neue Aula, Wilhelmstr.. Across the street from the Neue Aula (right by the Neue Aula bus stop) is a university shop, selling sweaters, mugs, hats, and other things with the University logo printed on it.  edit
Eat[edit]
One of the most popular places in Tübingen is the Neckarmüller, serving a regional beer brewed in Mössingen with the Swabian specialty Brezeln or an onion dish called Zwiebelkuchen. You can sit outdoors in the beer garden and enjoy the view of the Neckar and its stalk boats.
Aksaray 3 is considered the best place in Tübingen to enjoy a tasty Döner or some Pizza. Don't miss it!
One of the more special places to eat is the Mauganeschtle, right next to the castle, with a nice small garden above the city. It specializes in a special Swabian dish called "Maultasche" which is basically a large ravioli and comes in all different kinds of flavors. The restaurant is a bit posh and a little on the costly side, though. [13]
An excellent but usually overbooked Italian restaurant is the Al Dente below the main church; try the pizza with fresh tomatoes.
Get the best french fries in town from X on Kornhausstrasse (take Marktgasse off the Marktplatz, it will take you straight to it). In summertime, hundreds of students do this, and take them along with a beer to the marketplace and spend a warm summer's night right there, squatting on the cobblestones.
Manufaktur, on Haagtorplatz, serves large pizzas for about 5 euros.
Istanbul, just on the south side of the Neckarbruecke, serves some of the best Turkish food in town.
Across the street from the city administration building is a Thai market that serves dishes for about 5 euros.  Standing room only.
On Lange Gasse, just below the Stiftskirche, is an Indian market/restaurant that has inexpensive lunch specials.
Wok In, on Wilhelmstr. just by the Lustnauer Tor bus stop, serves filling, if mediocre, Chinese dishes at bargain prices.
El Chico, in the same building as the Neckarmueller, serves passable Mexican food by German standards.  Prices are about 10 euro per dish.
Kichererbse, on Metzgergasse, serves tasty vegetarian Lebanese food.
Eiscafe San Marco, in the Nonnenhaus, [14] serves huge ice cream dishes, including a plate of spaghetti made of ice cream, ice cream "hamburgers" etc.
At night, there are only a few places where you still can get something to eat: "X" near the marketplace, Mcdonalds' Drive-Through on the road to Reutlingen, Burger King at the train station, a small Italian take away in Mühlstrasse, a Döner Kebap next to the Epple-Haus (central bus station) is opened until 4 a.m. on the weekends, and of course any fuel station.
Stern, Lange Gasse 4. Their kitchen is open past midnight and the food is good and cheap (around 5 Euro per meal).  They have pizza, pasta, and a few other things.  Doubles as a bar and live music venue. Nice atmosphere.  edit
Delivery[edit]
There are a few places that deliver food, which may come in handy if you choose to stay here for any length of time.

Joeys [15] is a German chain specializing in American-style pizza.  The crust is a bit cardboardy but it's an old standby.
Pizza+Pasta [16] the name says it all. Except for the phone number and address.
Wienerwald [17] delivers grilled chicken, spaetzle, and other warm dishes.
Goldener Drachen, Philosophenweg 79,  0 7071 66019. Delivers relatively expensive Chinese food.
Nordring Service, Vogelbeerweg 4, 0 7071 9209202. Falafel, etc.
Drink[edit]
The best time to visit Tübingen is late spring or summer. Many of the pubs and cafes in the city center then have places to sit outside and hundreds of students populate the central marketplace until late at night, usually with beer from the nearby chip shop.

Schwärzlocher Hof [18]. A really old (1085 A.D.) homestead which is now both a restaurant and a beautiful beer garden just west of Tübingen. Go there when the sun sets and order a "Mostbowle", a local cider drink made from apple, mixed with soda.
Neckarmüller, right on the bank of the Neckar by the main bridge, has a beer garden where you can sit outside under the trees and enjoy views of the river on warm nights. Beers run from €2-€2.70. One can also buy Würsts and pretzels.
Weinstube Göhner in Schmiedtorstraße, one of several old wine taverns with a restaurant.
Storchen is a nice atmospheric place for a few beers. Can get very smoky, though. On Ammergasse, west of the X french fries and sausages place.
On warm nights, many students will buy a few bottles of beer or a bottle of wine and go sit in the Marktplatz [19] [20] and drink. Can be a very fun (and cheaper) alternative to a bar.
Tangente Jour, on the steps of the Stiftkirche, can be a fun place to drink a beer or cup of coffee and people watch.
Asmara [21], between the Stiftskirche and Marktplatz, has live bands (and a cover charge on weekends).
Blauer Turm [22] is a dance club next to the Blaue Brücke movie theater.
Mancuso [23], just across the street from the Blauer Turm is a club, that hosts parties and concerts. International and local DJs play a variety of non-mainstream music (electronic, reggae, soul, hip hop)
Little Italy is a bar across the street from the old city wall.
Pequenita is a little cozy bar at the Sternplatz with a relaxed atmosphere and sometimes DJs
Sudhaus [24] on the outskirts of town is big a concert and party location. In the summer a very nice beer garden.
Epple Haus [25] youth center. Punk, Reggae, and other parties and concerts. Cheap
Hanseatica [26] is a traditional coffee and tea bar that hasn't changed since the 60s. Cheap. Special student offers in the afternoon.
Top10 Tübingen [27] is the only big disco in the city center of Tübingen. On Wednesday students get in for free and only pay the half price.
Sleep[edit]
The tourist bureau is unable to do any bookings for you; it just gives you a list of accommodation, most of which is booked well in advance.

There is a youth hostel right next to the river, not too far away from the city center (10 min. walk) [28].
Another possibility, especially in summer, is the Neckar Camping [29], beautifully situated on the shore of the river Neckar and within walking distance (approx. 15 min.) of the old town.
A higher-end option is the Hotel am Schloss, just below the castle and in the middle of the Old Town. Double rooms are approximately €124.
Get out[edit]
About 6 km north of Tübingen, right in the Schönbuch forest reservation, is the old cistercian monastery (founded 1187 A.D.) of Bebenhausen with a small village next to it, especially nice to visit at night when part of the monastery is illuminated.
It's an easy day trip to see the Burg Hohenzollern [30], a fairytale castle dramatically set on top of a conical hill.

The town hall in Tübingen, Ger.Tübingen,  city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. The city lies along the Neckar River at its junction with the Ammer and Steinlach rivers, south of Stuttgart. Originating as Castra Alamannorum around the castle of the counts palatine of Tübingen (first mentioned in 1078) and recorded as a town in 1231, it was purchased by the counts of Württemberg in 1342, and the county became a duchy in 1495. It was captured in 1519 by the Swabian League, and during the Thirty Years’ War it fell to Holy Roman Empire troops (1634), the Swedes (1638), and the French (1647).A publishing centre, Tübingen also has metalworking and chemical and clothing production. Tourism contributes to the local economy. The city is the seat of the prestigious University of Tübingen, founded by Count Eberhard VI (later Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg) in 1477. Students who have attended the university’s Protestant theological seminary, established by Duke Ulrich in 1534, include the astronomer Johannes Kepler, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. The poet Ludwig Uhland was born in Tübingen in 1787.
The city’s most conspicuous building is the ducal castle of Hohentübingen, built in the 16th–17th century on earlier foundations and now housing several institutes of the university. The Gothic Stiftskirche of St. George (1470–90) contains fine stained glass and tombs of the dukes of Württemberg. The town hall, dating from 1435, has been much restored. Pop. (2005 est.) 83,496.

				Site Tübingen
			In the laboratories of the DZNE Tübingen, scientists investigate the causes and mechanisms of nerve diseases at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels. Special attention is given to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and rare movement disorders such as ataxias.As a result, the Tübingen experts are studying nerve-damaging inflammatory processes in the brain as well as hereditary factors that can play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as some gene variants can increase the risk of disease or even directly trigger a disease, while other variants protect against it. At the DZNE Tübingen, researchers therefore hope to discover such risk and protection factors in order to pave the way for new measures in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

		Through human clinical studies, scientists at the DZNE in Tübingen are also working on a better method for early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ataxias, and on new therapeutic measures. To this end, they are examining the research participants to find biomarkers, which are measurable biological indicators (in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, for example) that can be used to detect a disease and assess how it will progress. Clinical research in Tübingen is also dedicated to the rare, hereditary form of Parkinson’s disease.

Tübingen (German: [ˈtyːbɪŋən] (listen); Swabian: Dibenga) is a traditional university city in central Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated 30 km (19 mi) south of the state capital, Stuttgart, and developed on both sides of the Neckar and Ammer rivers. As of 2014[update][3] about one in three of the 90,000 people[citation needed] living in Tübingen is a student. As of the 2018/2019 winter semester, 27,665 students attend the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen.[citation needed] The city has the lowest median age in Germany, in part due to its status as a university city. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of a citizen of Tübingen is 39.1 years.[citation needed]
Immediately north of the city lies the Schönbuch, a densely wooded nature park. The Swabian Alb mountains rise about 13 km (8 mi) (beeline Tübingen City to Roßberg - 869 m) to the southeast of Tübingen.
The Ammer and Steinlach rivers are tributaries of the Neckar river, which flows in an easterly direction through the city, just south of the medieval old town. Large parts of the city are hilly, with the Schlossberg and the Österberg in the city centre and the Schnarrenberg and Herrlesberg, among others, rising immediately adjacent to the inner city.
The highest point is at about 500 m (1,640.42 ft) above sea level near Bebenhausen in the Schönbuch forest, while the lowest point is 305 m (1,000.66 ft) in the city's eastern Neckar valley. The geographical centre of the state of Baden-Württemberg is in a small forest called Elysium, near the Botanical Gardens of the city's university.


History[edit]
Further information: County Palatine of Tübingen
The area was probably first settled by ancient humans in the 12th millennium BC. The Romans left some traces here in AD 85, when they built a limes frontier wall at the Neckar River. Tübingen dates from the 6th or 7th century, when the region was populated by the Alamanni people. Some historians argue that the Battle of Solicinium was fought at Spitzberg, a mountain in Tübingen, in AD 367, although there is no evidence for this.[citation needed]
Tübingen first appears in official records in 1191. The local castle, Hohentübingen, has records going back to 1078, when it was besieged by Henry IV, king of Germany. Its name was transcribed in Medieval Latin as Tuingia and Twingia.
From 1146, Count Hugo V (1125–52) was promoted to count palatine as Hugo I. Tübingen was established as the capital of a County Palatine of Tübingen. By 1231, Tübingen was a civitas, indicating recognition by the Crown of civil liberties and a court system.
In 1262, an Augustinian monastery was established by Pope Alexander IV in Tübingen; in 1272, a Franciscan monastery was founded. In 1300, a Latin school (today's Uhland-Gymnasium) was founded. During the Protestant Reformation, which Duke Ulrich of Württemberg converted to, he disestablished the Franciscan monastery in 1535.
In 1342, the county palatine was sold to Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg and incorporated into the County of Württemberg.

Between 1470 and 1483, St. George's Collegiate Church was built. The collegiate church offices provided the opportunity for what soon afterwards became the most significant event in Tübingen's history: the founding of the Eberhard Karls University by Duke Eberhard im Bart of Württemberg in 1477, thus making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It became soon renowned as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire, especially for theology (a Protestant faculty, Tübinger Stift, was established in 1535 in the former Augustinian monastery). Today, the university is still the biggest source of income for the residents of the city and one of the biggest universities in Germany with more than 26,000 students.
Between 1622 and 1625, the Catholic League occupied Lutheran Württemberg in the course of the Thirty Years' War. In the summer of 1631, the city was raided. In 1635/36 the city was hit by the Plague. In 1638, Swedish troops conquered Tübingen. Towards the end of the war, French troops occupied the city from 1647 until 1649.
In 1789, parts of the old town burned down, but were later rebuilt in the original style. In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading newspaper in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen by Johann Friedrich Cotta. From 1807 until 1843, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin lived in Tübingen in a tower overlooking the Neckar.
In the Nazi era, the Tübingen Synagogue was burned in the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938. The Second World War left the city largely unscathed, mainly because of the peace initiative of a local doctor, Theodor Dobler. It was occupied by the French army and became part of the French zone of occupation. From 1946 to 1952, Tübingen was the capital of the newly formed state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern (as French: Tubingue), before the state of Baden-Württemberg was created by merging Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The French troops had a garrison stationed in the south of the city until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.
In the 1960s, Tübingen was one of the centres of the German student movement and the Protests of 1968 and has ever since shaped left and green political views. Some radicalized Tübingen students supported the leftist Rote Armee Fraktion terrorist group, with active member Gudrun Ensslin, a local and a Tübingen student from 1960 to 1963, joining the group in 1968.
Although noticing such things today is largely impossible, as recently as the 1950s, Tübingen was a very socioeconomically divided city, with poor local farmers and tradesmen living along the Stadtgraben (City Canal) and students and academics residing around the Alte Aula and the Burse, the old university buildings. There, hanging on the Cottahaus, a sign commemorates Goethe's stay of a few weeks while visiting his publisher. The German tendency to memorialize every minor presence of its historical greats (comparable to the statement "Washington slept here" in the United States) is parodied on the building next door. This simple building, once a dormitory, features a plain sign with the words "Hier kotzte Goethe" (lit.: "Goethe puked here").
In the second half of the 20th century, Tübingen's administrative area was extended beyond what is now called the "core city" to include several outlying small towns and villages. Most notable among these is Bebenhausen, a village clustered around a castle and Bebenhausen Abbey, a Cistercian cloister about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Tübingen.

Overview[edit]
In 2020[update], the city had 90,000 inhabitants. Life in the city is dominated by its roughly 28,000 students. Tübingen is best described as a mixture of old and distinguished academic flair, including liberal and green politics on one hand and traditional German-style student fraternities on the other, with rural-agricultural environs and shaped by typical Lutheran-Pietist characteristics, such as austerity and a Protestant work ethic, and traditional Swabian elements, such as frugality, order, and tidiness. The city is home to many picturesque buildings from previous centuries and lies on the River Neckar.
In 1995[update], the German weekly magazine Focus published a national survey, according to which Tübingen had the highest quality of life of all cities in Germany. Factors taken into consideration included the infrastructure, the integration of bicycle lanes into the road system, a bus system connecting surrounding hills and valleys, late-night services, areas of the city that can be reached on foot, the pedestrianised old town, and other amenities and cultural events offered by the university. Tübingen is the city with the youngest average population in Germany.

Main sights[edit]
 View from the tower of StiftskircheIn central Tübingen, the Neckar divides briefly into two streams, forming the elongated Neckarinsel (Neckar Island), famous for its Platanenallee with high plane trees, which are around 200 years old. Pedestrians can reach the island via stairs on the narrow ends leading down from a bridge spanning the Neckar. During the summer, the Neckarinsel is occasionally the venue for concerts, plays, and literary readings. The row of historical houses across one side of the elongated Neckarinsel is called the Neckarfront and includes the house with adjoining tower where poet Friedrich Hölderlin stayed for the last 36 years of his life, as he struggled with mental instability.

Tübingen's Altstadt (old town) survived the World War II due to the city's lack of heavy industry. The result is a growing domestic tourism business as visitors come to wander through one of the few completely intact historic Altstädte in Germany. The highlights of Tübingen include its crooked cobblestone lanes, narrow-stair alleyways picking their way through the hilly terrain, streets lined with canals, and well-maintained traditional half-timbered houses.
Old city landmarks include the city hall on Markt Square and the Hohentübingen Castle, now part of the University of Tübingen. The central landmark is the Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Along with the rest of the city, the Stiftskirche was one of the first to convert to Martin Luther's protestant church. As such, it maintains (and carefully defends) several "Roman Catholic" features, such as patron saints. Below the Rathaus is a quiet, residential street called the Judengasse, the former Jewish neighborhood of Tübingen until the city's Jews were expelled in 1477. On the street corner is a plaque commemorating the fate of Tübingen's Jews.
The centre of Tübingen is the site of weekly and seasonal events, including regular market days on the Holzmarkt by the Stiftskirche and the Marktplatz by the Rathaus, an outdoor cinema in winter and summer, festive autumn and Christmas markets and (formerly) Europe's largest Afro-Brazilian festival.
Students and tourists also come to the Neckar River in the summer to visit beer gardens or go boating in Stocherkähne, the Tübingen equivalent of Oxford and Cambridge punts, only slimmer. A Stocherkahn carries up to 20 people. On the second Thursday of June, all Stocherkahn punts take part in a major race, the Stocherkahnrennen.
Bebenhausen Abbey lies in the village of Bebenhausen, a district of Tübingen. A subdivision of the pilgrimage route known as the Way of St. James starts here and runs through Tübingen.

Government[edit]
Tübingen is governed by the mayor, elected by citizens every eight years, and by the municipal council, elected by citizens every five years.[4] Boris Palmer, a former member of the Greens, is the mayor since 2007, re-elected in 2014 and 2022 and thus on his third term until 2030.[5]
Tübingen's council decided that the city should be climate-neutral by 2030.[6][7] In 2022, the city was the first in Germany to tax disposable food packaging.[8] Restaurants in Tübingen are charged 50 cents per disposable cup and cardboard bowl, and 20 cents per piece of cutlery.[9]

Regional structure[edit]
 Tübingen (lower right) on the Neckar, in southwest Germany
Tübingen is the capital of an eponymous district and an eponymous administrative region (Regierungsbezirk), before 1973 called Südwürttemberg-Hohenzollern.
Tübingen is, with nearby Reutlingen (about 15 km (9.3 mi) east), one of the two centre cities of the Neckar-Alb region.
Administratively, it is not part of the Stuttgart Region, bordering it to the north and west (Böblingen district). However, the city and northern parts of its district can be regarded as belonging to that region in a wider regional and cultural context.

Districts[edit]
Tübingen is divided into 22 districts, the city core of twelve districts (population of about 51,000) and ten outer districts (suburbs) (population of about 31,000):

Culture[edit]
Tübingen has a notable arts culture as well as nightlife. In addition to the full roster of official and unofficial university events that range from presentations by the university's official poet in residence to parties hosted by the student associations of each faculty, the city can boast of several choirs, theatre companies and nightclubs. Also, Tübingen's Kunsthalle (art exhibition hall), on the "Wanne", houses two or three exhibits of international note each year.

Population[edit]
Population development[edit]
Since World War II, Tübingen's population has almost doubled from about 45,000 to the current 88,000, also due to the incorporation of formerly independent villages into the city in the 1970s.
Currently, Lord Mayor Boris Palmer (Green Party) has set the ambitious goal of increasing the population of Tübingen to 100,000 within the next several years. To achieve this, the city is closing gaps between buildings within the city proper by allowing new houses to be built there; this is also to counter the tendency of urban sprawl and land consumption that has been endangering the preservation of rural landscapes of Southern Germany.

Research in Tübingen
Tübingen is a special place for research. Very few locations offer such a wide range of research areas in such close proximity - both physically and figuratively. Not only are all of Tübingen's research institutions just a stone's throw away from each other, they also collaborate closely within the Tübingen Research Campus.


Excellence Strategy
Tübingen's unique research environment provides an ideal ground for collaborative projects in various areas. This is one of the many reasons why Tübingen is receiving funding from the German Federal and State Governments Excellence Strategy. As a consequence, excellence attracts further excellence: Over the years, more and more top-level research institutions have come to the city, forming the rich and vibrant academic community of the Tübingen Research Campus.


Joint Initiatives in Tübingen
Tübingen is an ideal place for collaboration due to the physical proximity of the partners of the TRC, which are further embedded in regional, national and international networks. Graduate and PhD programs also benefit from the presence of top-level experts at different research institutions, making Tübingen a hotspot for interdisciplinary graduate training. Here, you find a list of examples of local cooperation projects.

The City of Tübingen - some basic facts
Tübingen is an old city, but it has one of the youngest populations in Germany: the inhabitants are only 39 years old on average. 28,500 of the 90,000 residents are students. The town is famous for its unique flair, combining the charm of a lovingly restored old town center with the bustling spirit of a young student town.   Tübingen is located about 30 miles south of Stuttgart between the Schönbuch Natural Park and the Swabian Alb. On the south side of the old town flows the river Neckar.  The City of Tübingen provides a map with places of interest (in German) to help you find your way around. 


Cost of Living
Despite being a comparatively small city, Tübingen is an expensive place to live. Rents especially are among the highest in the country. In total, you should expect to spend at least EUR 950 - 1000/month for your living costs as a single person.If you will need a residence permit to stay in Germany, you will have to provide proof of sufficient financial means. For a single person, the official monthly requirement isEUR 502 +
Cost of rent (including additional, heating costs and electricity  
(for people with a work contract) EUR 100 “Werbungskostenpauschale” (income-related lump sum) 
(for people without a work contract) cost of health insurance.  
For visa and residence permits for the purpose of study (§ 16 b), the official requirement is EUR 934/month (2023). Please note that particularly the first two months will be expensive because you might need to buy things like household items, tickets for public transportation/a bike, apply for a residence permit etc. However, of course your expenditures also depend on your individual lifestyle.Short list of main costs (monthly)Accommodation: private one-room apartment or PhD student dormitory

Please contact the University of Tübingen's international admissions team for details.


Safety in Tübingen
Tübingen is a safe city with a very low crime rate, even by German standards. Nonetheless, train stations may attract dodgy individuals, so please be careful around these areas, especially at night. Generally, it’s better to not walk alone at night if you can avoid it.  Being a very bike-friendly city, one crime that is unfortunately comparatively frequent is bike theft. Make sure to invest in a good lock, and don’t leave your bike unattended in town for too long, especially if it looks expensive.  We strongly recommend to always lock your front door and close all windows when you leave the house. 


Being LGBT* in Tübingen
Tübingen is a very liberal city and generally a safe place to live, no matter your sexual orientation or gender identity. Same-sex marriage is legal in Germany, and anti-discrimination laws protect minorities. While homophobia and transphobia are unfortunately not yet a thing of the past, the majority of the Tübingen population has a neutral/positive attitude towards their fellow LGBT* citizens, and many people choose to be out at work and within their circle of friends. If you need further information about support groups and meetups, please contact your personal support.

The town hall in Tübingen, Ger.Tübingen,  city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. The city lies along the Neckar River at its junction with the Ammer and Steinlach rivers, south of Stuttgart. Originating as Castra Alamannorum around the castle of the counts palatine of Tübingen (first mentioned in 1078) and recorded as a town in 1231, it was purchased by the counts of Württemberg in 1342, and the county became a duchy in 1495. It was captured in 1519 by the Swabian League, and during the Thirty Years’ War it fell to Holy Roman Empire troops (1634), the Swedes (1638), and the French (1647).A publishing centre, Tübingen also has metalworking and chemical and clothing production. Tourism contributes to the local economy. The city is the seat of the prestigious University of Tübingen, founded by Count Eberhard VI (later Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg) in 1477. Students who have attended the university’s Protestant theological seminary, established by Duke Ulrich in 1534, include the astronomer Johannes Kepler, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. The poet Ludwig Uhland was born in Tübingen in 1787.
The city’s most conspicuous building is the ducal castle of Hohentübingen, built in the 16th–17th century on earlier foundations and now housing several institutes of the university. The Gothic Stiftskirche of St. George (1470–90) contains fine stained glass and tombs of the dukes of Württemberg. The town hall, dating from 1435, has been much restored. Pop. (2005 est.) 83,496.

			In the laboratories of the DZNE Tübingen, scientists investigate the causes and mechanisms of nerve diseases at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels. Special attention is given to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and rare movement disorders such as ataxias.As a result, the Tübingen experts are studying nerve-damaging inflammatory processes in the brain as well as hereditary factors that can play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as some gene variants can increase the risk of disease or even directly trigger a disease, while other variants protect against it. At the DZNE Tübingen, researchers therefore hope to discover such risk and protection factors in order to pave the way for new measures in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

		Through human clinical studies, scientists at the DZNE in Tübingen are also working on a better method for early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ataxias, and on new therapeutic measures. To this end, they are examining the research participants to find biomarkers, which are measurable biological indicators (in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, for example) that can be used to detect a disease and assess how it will progress. Clinical research in Tübingen is also dedicated to the rare, hereditary form of Parkinson’s disease.

Tübingen (German: [ˈtyːbɪŋən] (listen); Swabian: Dibenga) is a traditional university city in central Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated 30 km (19 mi) south of the state capital, Stuttgart, and developed on both sides of the Neckar and Ammer rivers. As of 2014[update][3] about one in three of the 90,000 people[citation needed] living in Tübingen is a student. As of the 2018/2019 winter semester, 27,665 students attend the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen.[citation needed] The city has the lowest median age in Germany, in part due to its status as a university city. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of a citizen of Tübingen is 39.1 years.[citation needed]
Immediately north of the city lies the Schönbuch, a densely wooded nature park. The Swabian Alb mountains rise about 13 km (8 mi) (beeline Tübingen City to Roßberg - 869 m) to the southeast of Tübingen.
The Ammer and Steinlach rivers are tributaries of the Neckar river, which flows in an easterly direction through the city, just south of the medieval old town. Large parts of the city are hilly, with the Schlossberg and the Österberg in the city centre and the Schnarrenberg and Herrlesberg, among others, rising immediately adjacent to the inner city.
The highest point is at about 500 m (1,640.42 ft) above sea level near Bebenhausen in the Schönbuch forest, while the lowest point is 305 m (1,000.66 ft) in the city's eastern Neckar valley. The geographical centre of the state of Baden-Württemberg is in a small forest called Elysium, near the Botanical Gardens of the city's university.


History[edit]
Further information: County Palatine of Tübingen
The area was probably first settled by ancient humans in the 12th millennium BC. The Romans left some traces here in AD 85, when they built a limes frontier wall at the Neckar River. Tübingen dates from the 6th or 7th century, when the region was populated by the Alamanni people. Some historians argue that the Battle of Solicinium was fought at Spitzberg, a mountain in Tübingen, in AD 367, although there is no evidence for this.[citation needed]
Tübingen first appears in official records in 1191. The local castle, Hohentübingen, has records going back to 1078, when it was besieged by Henry IV, king of Germany. Its name was transcribed in Medieval Latin as Tuingia and Twingia.
From 1146, Count Hugo V (1125–52) was promoted to count palatine as Hugo I. Tübingen was established as the capital of a County Palatine of Tübingen. By 1231, Tübingen was a civitas, indicating recognition by the Crown of civil liberties and a court system.
In 1262, an Augustinian monastery was established by Pope Alexander IV in Tübingen; in 1272, a Franciscan monastery was founded. In 1300, a Latin school (today's Uhland-Gymnasium) was founded. During the Protestant Reformation, which Duke Ulrich of Württemberg converted to, he disestablished the Franciscan monastery in 1535.
In 1342, the county palatine was sold to Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg and incorporated into the County of Württemberg.

Between 1470 and 1483, St. George's Collegiate Church was built. The collegiate church offices provided the opportunity for what soon afterwards became the most significant event in Tübingen's history: the founding of the Eberhard Karls University by Duke Eberhard im Bart of Württemberg in 1477, thus making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe. It became soon renowned as one of the most influential places of learning in the Holy Roman Empire, especially for theology (a Protestant faculty, Tübinger Stift, was established in 1535 in the former Augustinian monastery). Today, the university is still the biggest source of income for the residents of the city and one of the biggest universities in Germany with more than 26,000 students.
Between 1622 and 1625, the Catholic League occupied Lutheran Württemberg in the course of the Thirty Years' War. In the summer of 1631, the city was raided. In 1635/36 the city was hit by the Plague. In 1638, Swedish troops conquered Tübingen. Towards the end of the war, French troops occupied the city from 1647 until 1649.
In 1789, parts of the old town burned down, but were later rebuilt in the original style. In 1798 the Allgemeine Zeitung, a leading newspaper in early 19th-century Germany, was founded in Tübingen by Johann Friedrich Cotta. From 1807 until 1843, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin lived in Tübingen in a tower overlooking the Neckar.
In the Nazi era, the Tübingen Synagogue was burned in the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938. The Second World War left the city largely unscathed, mainly because of the peace initiative of a local doctor, Theodor Dobler. It was occupied by the French army and became part of the French zone of occupation. From 1946 to 1952, Tübingen was the capital of the newly formed state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern (as French: Tubingue), before the state of Baden-Württemberg was created by merging Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. The French troops had a garrison stationed in the south of the city until the end of the Cold War in the 1990s.
In the 1960s, Tübingen was one of the centres of the German student movement and the Protests of 1968 and has ever since shaped left and green political views. Some radicalized Tübingen students supported the leftist Rote Armee Fraktion terrorist group, with active member Gudrun Ensslin, a local and a Tübingen student from 1960 to 1963, joining the group in 1968.
Although noticing such things today is largely impossible, as recently as the 1950s, Tübingen was a very socioeconomically divided city, with poor local farmers and tradesmen living along the Stadtgraben (City Canal) and students and academics residing around the Alte Aula and the Burse, the old university buildings. There, hanging on the Cottahaus, a sign commemorates Goethe's stay of a few weeks while visiting his publisher. The German tendency to memorialize every minor presence of its historical greats (comparable to the statement "Washington slept here" in the United States) is parodied on the building next door. This simple building, once a dormitory, features a plain sign with the words "Hier kotzte Goethe" (lit.: "Goethe puked here").
In the second half of the 20th century, Tübingen's administrative area was extended beyond what is now called the "core city" to include several outlying small towns and villages. Most notable among these is Bebenhausen, a village clustered around a castle and Bebenhausen Abbey, a Cistercian cloister about 2 miles (3.2 km) north of Tübingen.

Overview[edit]
In 2020[update], the city had 90,000 inhabitants. Life in the city is dominated by its roughly 28,000 students. Tübingen is best described as a mixture of old and distinguished academic flair, including liberal and green politics on one hand and traditional German-style student fraternities on the other, with rural-agricultural environs and shaped by typical Lutheran-Pietist characteristics, such as austerity and a Protestant work ethic, and traditional Swabian elements, such as frugality, order, and tidiness. The city is home to many picturesque buildings from previous centuries and lies on the River Neckar.
In 1995[update], the German weekly magazine Focus published a national survey, according to which Tübingen had the highest quality of life of all cities in Germany. Factors taken into consideration included the infrastructure, the integration of bicycle lanes into the road system, a bus system connecting surrounding hills and valleys, late-night services, areas of the city that can be reached on foot, the pedestrianised old town, and other amenities and cultural events offered by the university. Tübingen is the city with the youngest average population in Germany.

Main sights[edit]
 View from the tower of StiftskircheIn central Tübingen, the Neckar divides briefly into two streams, forming the elongated Neckarinsel (Neckar Island), famous for its Platanenallee with high plane trees, which are around 200 years old. Pedestrians can reach the island via stairs on the narrow ends leading down from a bridge spanning the Neckar. During the summer, the Neckarinsel is occasionally the venue for concerts, plays, and literary readings. The row of historical houses across one side of the elongated Neckarinsel is called the Neckarfront and includes the house with adjoining tower where poet Friedrich Hölderlin stayed for the last 36 years of his life, as he struggled with mental instability.

Tübingen's Altstadt (old town) survived the World War II due to the city's lack of heavy industry. The result is a growing domestic tourism business as visitors come to wander through one of the few completely intact historic Altstädte in Germany. The highlights of Tübingen include its crooked cobblestone lanes, narrow-stair alleyways picking their way through the hilly terrain, streets lined with canals, and well-maintained traditional half-timbered houses.
Old city landmarks include the city hall on Markt Square and the Hohentübingen Castle, now part of the University of Tübingen. The central landmark is the Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Along with the rest of the city, the Stiftskirche was one of the first to convert to Martin Luther's protestant church. As such, it maintains (and carefully defends) several "Roman Catholic" features, such as patron saints. Below the Rathaus is a quiet, residential street called the Judengasse, the former Jewish neighborhood of Tübingen until the city's Jews were expelled in 1477. On the street corner is a plaque commemorating the fate of Tübingen's Jews.
The centre of Tübingen is the site of weekly and seasonal events, including regular market days on the Holzmarkt by the Stiftskirche and the Marktplatz by the Rathaus, an outdoor cinema in winter and summer, festive autumn and Christmas markets and (formerly) Europe's largest Afro-Brazilian festival.
Students and tourists also come to the Neckar River in the summer to visit beer gardens or go boating in Stocherkähne, the Tübingen equivalent of Oxford and Cambridge punts, only slimmer. A Stocherkahn carries up to 20 people. On the second Thursday of June, all Stocherkahn punts take part in a major race, the Stocherkahnrennen.
Bebenhausen Abbey lies in the village of Bebenhausen, a district of Tübingen. A subdivision of the pilgrimage route known as the Way of St. James starts here and runs through Tübingen.

Government[edit]
Tübingen is governed by the mayor, elected by citizens every eight years, and by the municipal council, elected by citizens every five years.[4] Boris Palmer, a former member of the Greens, is the mayor since 2007, re-elected in 2014 and 2022 and thus on his third term until 2030.[5]
Tübingen's council decided that the city should be climate-neutral by 2030.[6][7] In 2022, the city was the first in Germany to tax disposable food packaging.[8] Restaurants in Tübingen are charged 50 cents per disposable cup and cardboard bowl, and 20 cents per piece of cutlery.[9]

Regional structure[edit]
 Tübingen (lower right) on the Neckar, in southwest Germany
Tübingen is the capital of an eponymous district and an eponymous administrative region (Regierungsbezirk), before 1973 called Südwürttemberg-Hohenzollern.
Tübingen is, with nearby Reutlingen (about 15 km (9.3 mi) east), one of the two centre cities of the Neckar-Alb region.
Administratively, it is not part of the Stuttgart Region, bordering it to the north and west (Böblingen district). However, the city and northern parts of its district can be regarded as belonging to that region in a wider regional and cultural context.

Districts[edit]
Tübingen is divided into 22 districts, the city core of twelve districts (population of about 51,000) and ten outer districts (suburbs) (population of about 31,000):
Core city districts:


Französisches Viertel
Österberg
Schönblick/Winkelwiese
Lustnau
Südstadt
Universität
Waldhäuser Ost
Wanne
Weststadt
Zentrum

Outer districts:


Ammerbuch
Bebenhausen
Bühl
Derendingen
Hagelloch
Hirschau
Kilchberg
Pfrondorf
Unterjesingen
Weilheim, Baden-Württemberg

Culture[edit]
Tübingen has a notable arts culture as well as nightlife. In addition to the full roster of official and unofficial university events that range from presentations by the university's official poet in residence to parties hosted by the student associations of each faculty, the city can boast of several choirs, theatre companies and nightclubs. Also, Tübingen's Kunsthalle (art exhibition hall), on the "Wanne", houses two or three exhibits of international note each year.

Population[edit]
Population development[edit]
Since World War II, Tübingen's population has almost doubled from about 45,000 to the current 88,000, also due to the incorporation of formerly independent villages into the city in the 1970s.
Currently, Lord Mayor Boris Palmer (Green Party) has set the ambitious goal of increasing the population of Tübingen to 100,000 within the next several years. To achieve this, the city is closing gaps between buildings within the city proper by allowing new houses to be built there; this is also to counter the tendency of urban sprawl and land consumption that has been endangering the preservation of rural landscapes of Southern Germany. [1]

Research in Tübingen
Tübingen is a special place for research. Very few locations offer such a wide range of research areas in such close proximity - both physically and figuratively. Not only are all of Tübingen's research institutions just a stone's throw away from each other, they also collaborate closely within the Tübingen Research Campus.


Excellence Strategy
Tübingen's unique research environment provides an ideal ground for collaborative projects in various areas. This is one of the many reasons why Tübingen is receiving funding from the German Federal and State Governments Excellence Strategy. As a consequence, excellence attracts further excellence: Over the years, more and more top-level research institutions have come to the city, forming the rich and vibrant academic community of the Tübingen Research Campus.


Joint Initiatives in Tübingen
Tübingen is an ideal place for collaboration due to the physical proximity of the partners of the TRC, which are further embedded in regional, national and international networks. Graduate and PhD programs also benefit from the presence of top-level experts at different research institutions, making Tübingen a hotspot for interdisciplinary graduate training. Here, you find a list of examples of local cooperation projects.

The City of Tübingen - some basic facts
Tübingen is an old city, but it has one of the youngest populations in Germany: the inhabitants are only 39 years old on average. 28,500 of the 90,000 residents are students. The town is famous for its unique flair, combining the charm of a lovingly restored old town center with the bustling spirit of a young student town.   Tübingen is located about 30 miles south of Stuttgart between the Schönbuch Natural Park and the Swabian Alb. On the south side of the old town flows the river Neckar.  The City of Tübingen provides a map with places of interest (in German) to help you find your way around. 


Cost of Living
Despite being a comparatively small city, Tübingen is an expensive place to live. Rents especially are among the highest in the country. In total, you should expect to spend at least EUR 950 - 1000/month for your living costs as a single person.If you will need a residence permit to stay in Germany, you will have to provide proof of sufficient financial means. For a single person, the official monthly requirement isEUR 502 +
Cost of rent (including additional, heating costs and electricity  
(for people with a work contract) EUR 100 “Werbungskostenpauschale” (income-related lump sum) 
(for people without a work contract) cost of health insurance.  
For visa and residence permits for the purpose of study (§ 16 b), the official requirement is EUR 934/month (2023). Please note that particularly the first two months will be expensive because you might need to buy things like household items, tickets for public transportation/a bike, apply for a residence permit etc. However, of course your expenditures also depend on your individual lifestyle.Short list of main costs (monthly)Accommodation: private one-room apartment or PhD student dormitory
350 - 800 EUR

Please contact the University of Tübingen's international admissions team for details.


Safety in Tübingen
Tübingen is a safe city with a very low crime rate, even by German standards. Nonetheless, train stations may attract dodgy individuals, so please be careful around these areas, especially at night. Generally, it’s better to not walk alone at night if you can avoid it.  Being a very bike-friendly city, one crime that is unfortunately comparatively frequent is bike theft. Make sure to invest in a good lock, and don’t leave your bike unattended in town for too long, especially if it looks expensive.  We strongly recommend to always lock your front door and close all windows when you leave the house. 


Being LGBT* in Tübingen
Tübingen is a very liberal city and generally a safe place to live, no matter your sexual orientation or gender identity. Same-sex marriage is legal in Germany, and anti-discrimination laws protect minorities. While homophobia and transphobia are unfortunately not yet a thing of the past, the majority of the Tübingen population has a neutral/positive attitude towards their fellow LGBT* citizens, and many people choose to be out at work and within their circle of friends. If you need further information about support groups and meetups, please contact your personal support.

The town hall in Tübingen, Ger.Tübingen,  city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. The city lies along the Neckar River at its junction with the Ammer and Steinlach rivers, south of Stuttgart. Originating as Castra Alamannorum around the castle of the counts palatine of Tübingen (first mentioned in 1078) and recorded as a town in 1231, it was purchased by the counts of Württemberg in 1342, and the county became a duchy in 1495. It was captured in 1519 by the Swabian League, and during the Thirty Years’ War it fell to Holy Roman Empire troops (1634), the Swedes (1638), and the French (1647).A publishing centre, Tübingen also has metalworking and chemical and clothing production. Tourism contributes to the local economy. The city is the seat of the prestigious University of Tübingen, founded by Count Eberhard VI (later Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg) in 1477. Students who have attended the university’s Protestant theological seminary, established by Duke Ulrich in 1534, include the astronomer Johannes Kepler, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, and the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. The poet Ludwig Uhland was born in Tübingen in 1787.
The city’s most conspicuous building is the ducal castle of Hohentübingen, built in the 16th–17th century on earlier foundations and now housing several institutes of the university. The Gothic Stiftskirche of St. George (1470–90) contains fine stained glass and tombs of the dukes of Württemberg. The town hall, dating from 1435, has been much restored. Pop. (2005 est.) 83,496.

				Site Tübingen
			In the laboratories of the DZNE Tübingen, scientists investigate the causes and mechanisms of nerve diseases at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels. Special attention is given to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and rare movement disorders such as ataxias.As a result, the Tübingen experts are studying nerve-damaging inflammatory processes in the brain as well as hereditary factors that can play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, as some gene variants can increase the risk of disease or even directly trigger a disease, while other variants protect against it. At the DZNE Tübingen, researchers therefore hope to discover such risk and protection factors in order to pave the way for new measures in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 

			Source: DZNE
		Through human clinical studies, scientists at the DZNE in Tübingen are also working on a better method for early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ataxias, and on new therapeutic measures. To this end, they are examining the research participants to find biomarkers, which are measurable biological indicators (in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, for example) that can be used to detect a disease and assess how it will progress. Clinical research in Tübingen is also dedicated to the rare, hereditary form of Parkinson’s disease.
